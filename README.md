### Abstract

How do people decide how to invest? Copying the behavior of others---social learning---plays a key role in making investment decisions, just like in many other social situations. How exactly people decide who's behavior to mirror is unclear. Using high-resolution data on trades and social interactions from a large social trading platform, we uncover a fundamental tension between popularity and performance in shaping imitation behavior. Despite having access to performance data, people overwhelmingly choose whom to mirror based on social popularity, a signal poorly correlated with actual performance. This bias, reinforced by cognitive constraints and slow-changing popularity dynamics, results in widespread underperformance. People who frequently revise their mirroring choices (social explorers) consistently outperform those who maintain more static connections. We show that prioritizing performance over popularity in social signals dramatically improves both individual and collective outcomes in trading platforms. These findings expose the hidden inefficiencies of social learning and suggest design principles for more effective platforms.
